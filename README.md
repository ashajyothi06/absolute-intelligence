**Assignment Title**: Enhance and Deploy the Omniplex Project with Claude.ai Style

**Objective**

This assignment evaluates your ability to work with an existing codebase, improve UI design, integrate third-party APIs, and deploy on a cloud platform. The primary focus is on your **problem-solving approach** and **development process**.

**Task Overview**

1. **UI Enhancement**
- **Goal**: Update the login page UI to match **Claude.ai’s** design principles, focusing on simplicity, responsiveness, and a user-friendly interface.
- **Action Steps**:
- Clone the Omniplex project from GitHub:[ Omniplex Repository]
- Analyze the existing login page and redesign it to align with **Claude.ai’s** style guide using CSS and modern UI frameworks.
- Ensure the page is **mobile-responsive** and **aesthetically clean**.
2. **API Integration**
- **Goal**: Integrate a meaningful public API from **RapidAPI** to add dynamic functionality.
- **Action Steps**:
- Explore APIs from[ RapidAPI Hub](https://rapidapi.com/hub).
- Choose an API that adds value, e.g., weather data, stock market updates, or news feed.
- Implement the API integration in the Omniplex project, ensuring seamless data flow and proper error handling.
- Display the API response dynamically within a relevant page.
3. **Deployment**
- **Goal**: Deploy the modified project on **Azure** or any other cloud platform.
- **Action Steps**:
- Set up an Azure account or use another cloud service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).
- Configure necessary deployment resources, such as a virtual machine, database, and storage.
- Deploy the application and ensure it is **accessible via a public link**.
- Validate that all features, including the new UI and API integration, are fully functional.
4. **Use of AI Tools**
- **Goal**: Leverage AI tools or coding assistants to enhance development efficiency.
- **Action Steps**:
- Use AI tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **ChatGPT**, or other relevant frameworks during coding.
- Document how these tools were utilized to assist in development (e.g., generating boilerplate code, debugging, enhancing UI designs).
5. **Bonus Task (Optional)**
- **Goal**: Create a Claude.ai agent capable of browsing and interacting with the deployed website.
- **Action Steps**:
- Design an AI agent that navigates through key pages and demonstrates core features.
- Ensure the agent interacts with the API integration or any new feature.
- Provide a **demo video** or **detailed instructions** showing the agent's navigation, interaction, and overall understanding of the website.
